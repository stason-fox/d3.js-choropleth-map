# d3.js Choropleth Map

#### Description: Choropleth map created with d3.js. Tools used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

I created a choropleth map using d3.js that displays the percentage of adults age 25 and older with a bachelor's degree or higher between the years 2010 - 2014. I designed it so that when you hover over a county, it shows the county name, state, county FIPS code, and bachelor's percentage. I also created a legend that shows the four different colors in the map that describe the percentage of people with bachelor's degrees.
